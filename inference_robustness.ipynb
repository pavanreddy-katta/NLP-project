good intentions the major discrepency i would point out at is that petroleum based products are her go to moisturizer petroleum jelly and petro based ingredients are very cheap for companies to use so it s been highly popular however it s been banned for use in cosmetics or skin care ingredients in europe because it s been shown to often carry carcinogens it does after all come from the ground it is actually currently going through fda retesting right now in the united states because of this google petrolatum cosmetic toxin data it takes waaaay longer to ban something in the us than other countries if it s been shown to cause some problems because of this any company i sold ingredients to that was big enough to be a world wide company would not order any petroleum based ingredients because they are banned as toxic overseas already and are expected to be here in the next few years yes petroleum jelly what people put on their babies in the united states is banned as a skin ingredient elsewhere and expected to be banned here if tests go as expected she has her own cosmetics line that uses many controversial but very cheap ingredients that bothers me for example she is against all natural and organic ingredients and says so clearly however these have been shown in so many cases to not only work better but be healthier yet they are far more expensive for a company to use in manufacturing in looking at her own cosmetics line she certainly doesn t seem to go for the most proven yet more costly and natural ingredients they are instead quite basic and inexpensive i am not saying this is profit driven i am saying that cosmetic scientists have much to say about it there are many things the basic consumer is not aware of for example sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate are some of the worst cleaning agents you can use in your hair are highly stripping and are also used in industrial floor cleaners yet in the united states we equate foaming with clean and these are high foaming agents they are also not used in europe where there is more consumer knowledge about cosmetics and ingredients marketing wise and price wise shampoo companies get more profit from using these however if you locate a shampoo that is sulfate and paraben free they are getting far easier to find now as the consumers in the us become more smart on what they are using on their bodies your hair will shine if you dye your hair and avoid these ingredients your color stays in twice as long but if you go to a hotel and use a cheap shampoo with these in it you ll see a great deal of the color wash out that day it s that stripping of your hair s natural moisturizers as well as color i have never had a hairdresser not commont on how incredibly healthy my hair is since i learned this and i dye it which they can t believe because that should be stripping but my hair gets no sls products so it s strong and shiny although she is a hater on natural ingredients science says otherwise now let s cut to acne products if you see commercials like proactive you d assume you should pay more for a name in reality all over the counter acne products are the exact same thing one of products either up to salycilic acid or up to benzoyl peroxide plus other inert ingredients they both work on acne differently but by law over the counter products can only contain that certain amount of either ingredient some products like proactive actually have less of the active ingredient than generic brands however you are paying for the marketing not a better product so forget the name turn the bottle over and look at the ingredients if benzoyl peroxide works better on your skin than salycilic acid use the cheapest product with it proactive wash only has and all other ingredients in it are inert you will see benzoyl peroxide listed as the only active ingredient on the back of the bottle so you are getting less but paying far more for example on the other hand if salycilic acid works better on your skin use a product with of that forget the name but you aren t going to get any difference in strength with a different product up to a certain amount it s illegal for an over the counter med to contain any more than this and there are only primary ways to fight acne in over the counter meds unless you go all natural and that s it the other ingredients are inert how do they both work benzoyl peroxide knocks off the top layer of skin cells to open pores salycilic acid is actually chemically similar to aspirin which is why you can put crushed aspirin with water on a zit in a pinch and get good results and sa will not only slough off the dead skin cells which clog pores as well but it will also fight the bacteria within the breakout and also prevent clogging of the pore in the future by helping to reduce the pore size because of this for most people salycilic acid is a better acne medication because it does more but everyone is different if your skin works best with benzoyl p just find a cheap brand with benzoyl p in it instead just remember to read the label in over the counter products benzoyl peroxide is the most it can contain by law or salycilic acid paying for water and other fillers or a product with only benzoyl peroxide is getting less but paying more for a company s ads and guess what does a product you use tingle cosmetic companies put things that tingle in the product that are inert to make you feel like they are working americans equate tingling or burning with it must be doing something you don t need to buy expensive tanners at the tanning salon buy a regular brand same thing but do not buy no ad sunscreen this is where you don t want to go generic those are worse and watery and won t stay on look it s a profit driven industry and these are just some examples unfortunately i feel this book is also profit driven in pushing the cheapest ingredients that are also used in the cosmetics that the author sells even though some of what she pushes the hardest have actually been banned in other countries due to skin problems and health problems and are expected to be banned here as well in spite of the alternatives being more expensive for cosmetic manufacturers which is why they are lobbying against it she mentions alcohol being drying and to avoid it which it is in hair care products such as mousse but there are ingredients in the best skin care lines or hair care products that contain the name alcohol that are good ingredients such as stearyl alcohol or benzyl alcohol which are fatty alcohols in fact stearyl alcohol acts as a thickener and is the exact opposite of drying so much so that it s used commercially in swimming pool liners to prevent the evaporation of water i kid you not benzyl alcohol is an all natural ingredient and is derived from plants and is commonly found in fruits and teas and found to be beneficial as a natural bacteria reducer and is very good for your skin you will find it in essential oils such as hyacinth and ylang ylang the idea of the book is a good one and she does have some useful information in it she just missed the mark according to cosmetic scientists in my own discussions with them and i have worked with the best and the brightest er product so forget the name turn the bottle over and look at the ingredients if benzoyl peroxide works better on your skin than salycilic acid use the cheapest product with it proactive wash only has and all other ingredients in it are inert you will see benzoyl peroxide listed as the only active

       "  'Raw Input': 'a book that makes you think about things you should be thinking about on so many levels when i was in high school it was clearly stated in the west mesa student handbook that a student s participation in activities not to be confused with sports was to be limited to a set number of activities that could not exceed a certain number of points the idea was clearly to distribute opportunities to students at what was then the largest high school in the state of new mexico so large in fact the school was on split session with juniors and seniors attending from to noon before the afternoon shift showed up under these rules a student would not be able to be student body president co editor of the newspaper a member of the national honor society compete in speech and debate and so plays but nobody stopped me even though the points associated with these activities and others were worth three times the proscribed limit of points from this experience i learned that i could do what i wanted despite the rules this is a rather dangerous thing for a teenager to learn but when i went to college i used these guiding principle to take upper division classes my first semester of college i was able to do this for two reasons first i entered college as a sophomore having taken the general college level examination placement test and having received thirty college credits basically you took a test and they compared your scores to the average college sophomore and if you did above average you got credit at the first college i attended they would give me credit for specific courses such as introduction to physics because of my score this astounded me because i had never even taken high school biology had not taken a math course since my freshman year you needed one credit of math to graduate and could not remember how you multiplied fractions i must have figured it out apparently the average college student was something of an idiot if i could get credit for physics i took three more specific clep tests and had credits without setting foot in a college classroom the second thing i did was to never see a college advisor after all they were the ones who knew the rules and would tell me i could not take the courses i wanted to take i e an early variation on the don t ask don t tell approach to conflict resolution this extended journey down memory lane represents my personal reaction to reading misfits in america which is lawrence r level s first volume in his series thine alabaster cities gleam a story of the last half of the twentieth century the thesis of the book and the subject of its final chapters has to do with the illegality of the vietnam war specifically in terms of constitutionality issues regarding the failure of congress to declare war and abrogating its detailed responsibilities to the president however in a larger sense velvel is not only explaining why the country is the way that it is and why vietnam became all that it became but why his main protagonist harry brontz is the man the velvel writes about it is that last part that inspired deep thoughts regarding my past and i think this volume will inspire others to do the same especially if they did not go on to law school i was the only member of my college debating team not to become a lawyer although i did toy with the notion of going for fun i was trying to get a teaching job of a university that would allow its professors to attend the law school for free to study constitutional law clearly i ascribed to oscar wilde s witticism that the study of law is sublime and its practice vulgar however after reading the manifesto of reforms that dean velvel enumerates in his message to students at the massachusetts school of law i am willing to rethink my position although probably not my vocation misfits in america constitutes an argument more than a narrative although arranged chronologically overall velvel will jump back and forth in time to make a point rather than to simply tell a story his personal experiences serve as both the evidence and the rational for his scathing critique on what is wrong with the american legal system from the hallowed halls of elite law schools to the failure of the united states supreme court the latter is particularly damning because velvel is able to castigate the court from both the liberal and conservative perspectives former debaters particularly enjoy arguments where you win either way the evidence for these arguments comes from both the real world and the world of academe with the personal experiences of the protagonists in the book harry brontz and lionel wolfe who are presented as law school classmates and fraternity brothers at michigan the term protagonists used to describe harry brontz lionel wolfe and other characters in this book is important because although this is a memoir you can forget about spending your title googling their names to find out what these former graduates of the michigan law school are up to today velvel cites abraham lincoln early on as a key role model but his approach here brings to mind silence dogood those who are so inclined and who are in a position to do so can do their own annotations as to which school is midwest state unmask the various characters and settle the argument as to who had the highest gpa in the history of harvard law school such points are moot for me because i am more concerned with what is real than what is true and velvel s book rings real perception is key a point made implicitly but repeatedly in this book ultimately i see his position as being more anti conservative than liberal a natural consequence of the political system being inherently conservative that all three branches of government are currently controlled by political conservatives only strengthens the point although it also means incumbents get to bear the brunt of these attacks but velvel had harsh words for just about everybody in washington d c with the notable exception of william o douglas so i see a plague being called down on all of their branches i freely admit that i am focusing more on what velvel has to say about the causes behind the problems that exist today and clearly i am playing it out in my own mind on much more of a personal level than on the social after all there are two books to go in this series and i expect my thinking to progress to dealing more with effects and solutions as i continue to read because of my occupational psychosis i will be thinking more in terms of academia than of legal issues but dealing with students who act more like consumers and who demand to be entertained as a prerequisite to being educated pretty much forces such issues upon me fortunately the latter plays to me strength almost as much as the former offends me heart and soul i know that the rosie the riveter experiences of world war ii and the creation of the birth control pill were the key causal elements in liberating women in our culture and velvel comes up with something equally as important as a paradigm shift in the g i bill that the legislation was intended to have a big impact on housing for veterans but ended up transforming colleges because of the educational provisions seems obvious and the fact that such profound changes were unintentional another one of those ironies that confronts you with a choice between deep laughter and bitter tears the impact of sports and the self perpetuating machine that are the nation s law schools come into play as well until i reached the final set of chapters which on balance are considerably shorter than the early ones i was reading this book a chapter at a time before going to sleep the reasoning behind this approach was that after reading each chapter i needed to go through a personal dialectic critiquing velvel s claims in terms of my own knowledge and experience to come up with how it all makes sense to me the fact that velvel refers to professor kingsfield from the paper chase as professor kingsbury may well be a pun rather than a typographical error or mistake of recall but velvel also quotes one of the most significant philosophers of the th century lawrence peter berra three times in the book so he comes out ahead in my ledger obviously i personalized reading this book more than others but doing so does not preempt your ability to apply the lessons of misfits in america to current constitutional crises or undeclared wars it was just how i worked through the arguments and i think there is value for everybody in knowing how they were shaped and molded do i still do what i want count the number of words in this review or the number and types of reviews i have posted and see if that gives it away meanwhile dean velvel s latest blog has to do with the current events topic of electronic surveillance and i bet if you read this book you can hazard a guess as to what he is arguing with regards to that particular issue ybody in washington d c with the notable exception of william o douglas so i see a plague being called down on all of their branches i freely admit that i am focusing more on what velvel has to say about the causes behind the problems that exist today and clearly i am playing it out in my own mind on much more of a personal level than on the social after all there are two books to go in this

everybody in knowing how they were shaped and molded do i still do what i want count the number of words in this review or the number and types of reviews i have posted and see if that gives it away meanwhile dean velvel s latest blog has to do with the current events topic of electronic surveillance and i bet if you read this book you can hazard a guess as to what he is arguing with regards to that particular issue'},\n",

       "  'Raw Input': 'a good sequel almost as good as the first rebel angels is the second novel in libba bray s gemma doyle trilogy gemma and her friends are now in london for the winter holidays they are still attempting to figure out who circe is and stop her before she destroys the realms but they also trying to lead meaningful and fun social lives the experience london s high society and find themselves once again lost in the realms bray s second installment has all the fantasy and creativity of her first novel the girls have to learn how to behave in society especially when ann is lying to everyone about her past and gemma has to learn how to deal with her new romance with a viscount s son as well as her current relationship with kartik the theme of growing up never leaves the narrative and it is just as funny and clever as ever hello girl in the mirror you are gemma doyle and i ve no idea who you really are gemma is still trying to figure out who she really is she has many different faces that she puts on for her family and her friends she cannot figure out her purpose in life and throughout the entire novel she is being deceived by a woman that she saw as a friend and almost motherly figure she is trying to piece together clues to figure out who circe is but every clue she finds she manipulates to serve her own purposes she believes circe is her new teacher because she wants to believe it is her even when gemma is told that her teacher is not circe she doesn t believe her everything gemma does is to try to help but she has no one to guide her without tricking her another main theme in this novel is parents as protectors gemma s father is riddled with addiction after addiction and no matter how hard gemma or her brother try neither she nor he can help their father become clean gemma tries to heal him with magic but she finally realizes that she cannot heal him she can only help him find the way himself it is revealed that felicity s father sexually abused her when she was younger but felicity believed it was her fault felicity says that parents should protect their children but it is clear that is not always possible gemma and felicity both realize that they are strong and that they cannot bear their parents burdens bray also deals with the topic of racism after kartik and gemma kiss kartik tells her that she doesn t want to be with him because he is indian and the reader discovers that gemma never thought she had be demure or chaste with kartik because she knew nothing could ever happen i found this to be a shocking revelation because bray never tells you that interracial marriages didn t occur the book seems so modern that i completely forget that was unprecedented at the end of novel gemma asks kartik to join the order as an ally along with several other groups of people that had never been granted power by the order gemma is stretching across a divide and uniting people that had never been united before yet again bray deals with the ideas of grief and loss but in an entirely new way upon returning to the realms the girls discover that here their friend pippa is alive and well even though gemma has been told that no one can stay there and not cross over without becoming corrupted the reader can instantly see that pippa has not escaped corruption but the girls do not see it because they are happy to have their friend back after circe is defeated pippa is forced to make a choice cross over or enter the winterlands rather than cross over into the unknown pippa decides to join the corrupt in the winterlands this choice is not surprising because this is coming from the girl who chose a perfect dream world rather than be forced into an arranged marriage once again pippa has refused to accept reality she should realize that she has died but she doesn t and she chooses to become corrupt in the hopes that she can stay in the realms forever pippa also blames gemma for her death when she was the one who chose it creating parallels to modern day suicide gemma couldn t have done anything to save pippa because it was her choice but gemma still feels guilty about her death the character of miss moore once again has super amazing quotes about life and death and good and evil she says that maybe there is no good or evil only choices once she is revealed to be circe the reader is forced to think more clearly about the line between right and wrong circe is doing what she thinks is right for her but her motivations are selfish and harmful gemma choices constantly show that she is thinking not only about the safety of the realms but also of her friends and family kartik and gemma also discuss whether destiny exists or if life is controlled by choices leaving the answer up to the reader kartik makes it seem like it is the choices that you make that lead you to fulfilling your destiny giving a great purpose to every choice made the novel focuses heavily on deception and lies over the course of both books miss moore has been lying to the girls making them see her as an ally but in rebel angels there is also the deception of ann which is not so different from the lies of miss moore ann tells everyone in london society that she is rich and powerful when in fact she is poor and helpless both ann and miss moore are lying to try to get what they desperately desire they want to get out of the lives that have been chosen for them eventually they are both forced to come clean and ann loses the affection of gemma s brother and miss moore losses the affection of gemma in books the truth makes everything good and fine but it s not like that really is it no i suppose it only makes everything known but underneath all these wonderful themes or i guess i should say above the themes is a rich story about love and acceptance am i the only one who hated simon from the start i just kept shouting at the book rapist because he seemed like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader wonder how far he has gone before without someone saying no gemma s relationship with simon is fake polite and strained she finds him charming but there is always the secret of what she can do lurking under the surface and she knows that he wouldn t love her if he knew about it this relationship is directly contrasted with gemma s relationship with kartik she is free to be who she really is she doesn t have to pretend to be coy or lady like and they really only talk business though there are moments of genuine friendship and understanding the reason this relationship is so appealing to the reader and trust me i squeal every time they do something adorable is that it s so very romantic kartik and gemma are in their own little world and whenever they meet it has this danger behind it they are relying on one another for help and guidance and they ve grown trust and a bond that is separated from the real world the thing i find hilarious about kartik though is that he never does anything he literally never does anything they talk about what gemma needs to do but because he can t enter the realms he can t help her in any way he can only help her understand the clues she s found and then kiss her because the book needs some sexy romance but finally finally kartik gives up everything he has ever known to help gemma escape the rakshana and i think that he will finally do something instead they split up gemma sleeps for three days wakes up and never even thinks to check on him or ask him for help and then leaves for the realms to defeat circe she comes back and after like two days she goes to see him and asks him to be an ally it s been what a week i find this unforgivable kartik gave up his entire life to help her and then she leaves him sitting in his bedroom for a week he doesn t get to help her fight and he doesn t get to even see her it seems like kartik is only there for the kissing and i want to see him actually getting out and doing something i know this book is all about girl power and strength but really he needs to do something with his life but i really did like this book i m not sure that i liked it as much as the first one i wasn t really surprised by anything rebel angels threw at me but it was well written and the themes were great as always d like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader wonder how far he has gone before without someone saying no gemma s relationship with simon is fake polite and strained she finds him charming but there is always the secret of what she can do lurking

       "  'Raw Input': 'worth its weight ten times over in pieces of eight on one side stood the devil captain who backed by the merchant and royal official held near dictorial powers that served captialism globally on the other side stood the relentlessly dangerous narural world the deep blue sea in this fine and scholarly work by buford rediker the reader will find a bottom up history of the common seaman focusing on roughly the early th century some what like howard zinn s peoples history some years later on the american worker the sailor tar experiences of that time pointed in many ways toward the industrial revolution to come in the domain of culture as in others seamen were enmeshed in the momentous transition in which the world came to be governed by capitalism and class it is organized topically beginning with a survey of the seaman s world circa which tours the major ports of the british north atlantic describes the commodities piled on the docks and quays and details those aspects of political economy and history that shaped the seaman s life chapter discusses the organiztion and experience of work at sea chapter considers the wage in free wage labor and analyzes wage rates and negotiations chapter examines culture and community at sea chapter explores maritime authority and labor discipline chapter investigates the social world of piracy and how it effected the larger culture of maritime labor the conclusion analyzes the seaman s experience to the process of social change and working class development in america and england the jolly tar did indeed live in a world possessed of a sordid vicious side his creative survival is the suject of this book at times in gruesome details there are quotes in the oringinal written word and there are many detailed footnotes maps and several oringinal illustrations that were of the times it is very well written researhced in depth analyses of those times reading this is time well spent not only enriched by the history itself but more importantly how it coincides with the new world order s globalization of today s world in the words of one seaman those who would go to sea for pleasure would go to hell for pastime as the old sea song said a damned hard life full of toil and strife they took to the sea because they could not get bread by land work at sea meant virtual incarceration asa seaman was forcibly assimulated into a severe shipboard regimen of despotic authority discipline and control shipboard life constituted a binding chain of linked limits limited freedom limited movemen limited sensory stimulation and limited choices of liesure activities socil interaction food and play there was too little space aboard the ship and too much outside as an old salt explained to a green hand there is no justice or injustice on board ship my lad there are only two things duty and mutiny mind that all that you are ordered to do is duty all that you refuse to do is mutiny the green hand would soon find out what an almost universal feature of life was for an th century sailor the unrestricted power of the captain to treat his men with the utmost cruelty without redress since the capitalist mode of production ultimately requires the sale and purchase of labor poer in a marketthrough the medium of the wage a major imperative of early mpdern capitalist developmentwas the simultaneuos dispossession of large numbers of small property holders and the consolidation and centralization of newly available property in the hands of a minority the major sources of dispossession were disbanding of fuedal retainers the dissolution of feudal monasteries changes in agricultural methods foreclosure by debt and probably best known of all enclosure wealthy land owners enclosed their lands and extinguished the common rights they hang the man and flog the woman who steals the goose from off the common but let the greater criminal loose who steals the common from the goose old verse of the times the many were then suddenly and forcebly torn from their prior means of subsistence and hurled on the labor market as free unprotected and rightless proletarians they had no alternative but to sell their labor power to make a living the next stop between the devil the deep blue sea what i enjoyed most was that this period was protrayed by the author for what it was a long slow uneven and bloody transition from fuedalism to capitalism one illustration i liked by hogarth anticipated the claim that the gallows and whip lined the road to wage labor in this domain of culture as in others the seamen were emeshed in the momentous transition in which the world came to be governed by capitalism class the rise of deep sea supremacy began with the founding of the russian company the eastland company the levant company the east india company and considerably later the royal adventures into africa soon to become royal african company the history is something i never learned in high school for instance during queen anne s reign seaman had enterred the navy like men dragged to execution and that is precisely what naval service amounted to for untold thousands since almost half of all those pressed into the th th centuries died at sea or how a seaman wrote about the east india company but for nations to come and plant themselves in islands and countries by force and build forts and raise laws and force the people to customs against the true natures and people of the said places without their consent how this wiil stand with the law of god and the religion we profess lrt the world be the judge this book was published in iraq afghanistan were on the drawing board in the s or that a leading expert on illicit trade argues that in the early modern period smugglers accounted for at least one half the english overseas trade between and was the golden century of smuggling maritime workers in this early period by linking the producers and consumers of the world through their labors in the international markets were central to the accumulation of riches on ascale previously unimagined at the same time they were crucial to the emergence of new relations between capital and labor employments connected to shipping were notorious then as later a precarious occupations nice work if you can get it life and labor in precarious times by andrew ross about st century labor markets it should come as no surprise then that the collectivism that informed the seafaring work that the very term strike evolved from the decision of british seamen in to strike the sails of their vessels and thereby to cripple the commerce of the empire s capital city the collectivism of the ship was vertical that of the common wage earning seaman horizontal the international capitalist economy wasemerging as an increasingly cooperative totality and the strategically situated merchant seaman provided many of the links in the system the completely contractual and waged nature of maritime work represented a capital labor relation quite distinct from the landlord tenant master servant or master apprentice relationships the pay systems of the seamen were very well detailed and analysed from how they were intiated and how they evolved ship owners merchants and ship captains aspired to enhance the accumulation of capital by controlling wages food and drink or customary usage social access to the product spatial perogatives and the nature of the voyage inded the very process of accumulation was built upon thr bilked wages the pinched guts and often the very lives prematurely ended of men at sea a central part of capital s plan during the early and uncertain stages of expansion was to shift as many of the burdens and risks associated with the growing but ubstable atlantic economy as possible to the seaman s shoulders there were two networks of information one purveyed information about ship masters and their customary usage of sailors the other carried reports of the discipline skills and behavoir of the maritime workers the former was constructed by and for seamen the latter by and for ship owners merchants and captains the very sucess of pirates between and depended upon their access to the information that flowed through this informal network the pirate chapterwas my favorite probably sumed up best by pirate charles bellamy you are a sneaking puppy and so are those who submit to be governed by laws which rich men have made for their own security for the cowardly whelps have not the courage to defend what they get by their knavery but damn ye altogether they villify us the scoundrels do when there is only this difference they rob the poor under cover of law forsooth and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage or as pirate barnaby slush said without justice there can be no true discipline no love no followers so in essence the pirate ship was a school in social and economic democracy collectivism antiauthoritarianism and egalitarianism were the core values ate their hearts that of the common seaman s ethos the court system of those times upheld the perogatives of capital despite the legality of the matter enabling merchants and masters to respond as profitably as possible to international opportunities most commanders of those times cared not how much or in what way they can get it all to themselves and care not what little other people get under them they were all out to gain what they can either by hook or crook the social isolation of the captain like so much of maritime culture as a whole thus resulted from two very different social dynamics the search from above for corporate authority and the search from below for autonomy if i could do it over i would have read this before i read the the patrick o brien aubrey maturin series there is so much laid out in these pages that puts one not only in the sialor s soes but the ships as well extremely detailed and informative to the tasks at hand dr samuel johnson is one of my perennial favorites and he observed no man wii be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail for being on a ship is being in a jail with the chance of being drowned a man in jail has more room better food and more commonly better company epidemics and scurvy raged on royal ships and the men were caught in a machine from which there was no escape but desertion incapacitation or death or piracy the parallels about the first worldwide commercial globalization process closely rhymes with the current new world order globalization process highly recommended p s the history of power teaches us one thing if it is unchecked it will be abused bruce fein'},\n",

should realize that she has died but she doesn t and she chooses to become corrupt in the hopes that she can stay in the realms forever pippa also blames gemma for her death when she was the one who chose it creating parallels to modern day suicide gemma couldn t have done anything to save pippa because it was her choice but gemma still feels guilty about her death the character of miss moore once again has super amazing quotes about life and death and good and evil she says that maybe there is no good or evil only choices once she is revealed to be circe the reader is forced to think more clearly about the line between right and wrong circe is doing what she thinks is right for her but her motivations are selfish and harmful gemma choices constantly show that she is thinking not only about the safety of the realms but also of her friends and family kartik and gemma also discuss whether destiny exists or if life is controlled by choices leaving the answer up to the reader kartik makes it seem like it is the choices that you make that lead you to fulfilling your destiny giving a great purpose to every choice made the novel focuses heavily on deception and lies over the course of both books miss moore has been lying to the girls making them see her as an ally but in rebel angels there is also the deception of ann which is not so different from the lies of miss moore ann tells everyone in london society that she is rich and powerful when in fact she is poor and helpless both ann and miss moore are lying to try to get what they desperately desire they want to get out of the lives that have been chosen for them eventually they are both forced to come clean and ann loses the affection of gemma s brother and miss moore losses the affection of gemma in books the truth makes everything good and fine but it s not like that really is it no i suppose it only makes everything known but underneath all these wonderful themes or i guess i should say above the themes is a rich story about love and acceptance am i the only one who hated simon from the start i just kept shouting at the book rapist because he seemed like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader wonder how far he has gone before without someone saying no gemma s relationship with simon is fake polite and strained she finds him charming but there is always the secret of what she can do lurking under the surface and she knows that he wouldn t love her if he knew about it this relationship is directly contrasted with gemma s relationship with kartik she is free to be who she really is she doesn t have to pretend to be coy or lady like and they really only talk business though there are moments of genuine friendship and understanding the reason this relationship is so appealing to the reader and trust me i squeal every time they do something adorable is that it s so very romantic kartik and gemma are in their own little world and whenever they meet it has this danger behind it they are relying on one another for help and guidance and they ve grown trust and a bond that is separated from the real world the thing i find hilarious about kartik though is that he never does anything he literally never does anything they talk about what gemma needs to do but because he can t enter the realms he can t help her in any way he can only help her understand the clues she s found and then kiss her because the book needs some sexy romance but finally finally kartik gives up everything he has ever known to help gemma escape the rakshana and i think that he will finally do something instead they split up gemma sleeps for three days wakes up and never even thinks to check on him or ask him for help and then leaves for the realms to defeat circe she comes back and after like two days she goes to see him and asks him to be an ally it s been what a week i find this unforgivable kartik gave up his entire life to help her and then she leaves him sitting in his bedroom for a week he doesn t get to help her fight and he doesn t get to even see her it seems like kartik is only there for the kissing and i want to see him actually getting out and doing something i know this book is all about girl power and strength but really he needs to do something with his life but i really did like this book i m not sure that i liked it as much as the first one i wasn t really surprised by anything rebel angels threw at me but it was well written and the themes were great as always d like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader

congress call number rg b papers from a conference in on the beginning of human life major divisions fetal development assisted reproduction technology contraception abortion fetal research fetal tissue maternal fetal relationship medical ethical legal aspects defective fetuses newborns the editors of this collection are well aware of the religious reasonsfor raising the question of the beginning of human life but they present scientific data as presently knownrather than metaphysical speculationsabout the beginning of each human being fertilization creates a unique strand of dna in the human egg an unrepeatable human genome has come into being about half of these will not implant in the lining of the uterus some implanted fertilized eggs will not develop some embryos will divide forming twins some twins embryos will re combine after a few weeksand proceed to create just one individual the concept of a human person is much more elaboratethan the scientific description of an embryo usually personhood includessuch capacities as thinking and communicating we take our idea of personhood from our experienceas adult persons and with other adult persons hence our moral and metaphysical concepts of personhoodmay not correlate well with the scientific descriptionof the development of an embryo a fetus later a baby as medical science and technology progresses we are able to save smaller and smaller babies the courts and legislatures have attempted to definewhen a fetus will be viable in terms of weeks of gestationor the size of the fetus but there will never be a definite bright line everyone can agree upon at any given weight or length of gestation a few premature babies will survive and as the weight and size at birth increases more will survive especially with neo natal intensive care medical science and technology will continueto develop the capacity to save more abnormal fetuses than ever before if everything that can be done is done which is often the default scientific decision the human population will have more and more abnormal individuals if we want to prevent this from happening we need to make the moral and political decisionsabout which fetuses to save and which to allow to die people who are not part of the medical teamneed to help establish and implement guidelinesfor when to end life supports for defective fetuses and newborns in each individual case the parents must always be consulted setting rigid standards by law will do more harm than good assisted reproduction advances every year we human beings have more and more influenceon the genetic make up of the babies conceived and born this capacity to influence the genetic make up of the next generationcould be used for good or bad purposes to achieve trivial or meaningful changes who if anyone should control such future genetic powers fetuses brought into the world without any brainscan be used for organ donation to other infantswho have brains but are missing some other important parts should we define fetuses born without brains as born dead should permanent lack of consciousness be a sufficient criterion of death how shall we decide these extreme cases as well as the cases of fetuses born with less severe limitations the usesof fetal tissue has in the past been deeply entangledwith the emotional debate about abortion opponents believe that allowing the use of tissue from abortionswill encourage more abortions to be performed the answer to this worry is to make absolutely certainthat the decision for an abortion is completely separatefrom any later decision about the use of the fetal tissue however even tho these are completely separate decisions made by different people for different reasons there should also be some coordination of timing so that maximum benefit can be achievedfrom the donated organs and tissues this reviewer observes that people are especially emotional and often irrational when it comes to fetuses and newborns it is especially difficult for a prospective mother who may have invested tremendous emotional hope in her fetus to decide to donate her baby so that someone else might live she does not want any additional harm to come to her baby even if it was doomed from before birth better public education about fetuses who cannot liveand the need for their organs and tissueswould better prepare disappointed would be parentsfor donating the organs and tissues of their defective fetusesso that other babies and sometimes adults might live sometimes the interests of the fetus conflictwith the wishes of the pregnant woman when if ever does the state have the rightto step in and protect a fetus and if a fetus has rights that can be assertedagainst the rights of the pregnant woman does this not make the right to abortion meaningless sometimes health authorities have put pregnant woman in jailto prevent them from using drugs and or alcohol which would harm the developing fetus since the state will end up paying for the care of a damaged fetus this could be the basis of any claim of right to intervene but in most cases the state does not attempt to intervene the pregnant woman has a right to abort her pregnancy but usually the state has no power to intervene to protect the fetus reviewer s observations again a more rational society would license most adults to be parents then in the most extreme cases such as an alcoholic pregnant woman the woman would probably not have a license to become a parent if the health authorities are going to take the babyfrom the unlicensed mother at birth in any case then the state has a right to protect this fetusfrom further harm by the alcoholic pregnant woman if the state has a proprietary interest in the fetus this might be compared to the interest of a father who knows thatthe child will become entirely his responsibility after birth he will then do everything possible to prevent harm to the fetus including putting the pregnant woman into some confined situationto prevent further harm from alcohol and or drugs the liberty interests of the pregnant womanshould also be taken into account but if the fetus has already been declared a ward of the state even if the fetus is not a person with any legal rights then the pregnant woman could be forced to choosebetween going to some confined situation until the fetus is born for the protection of the fetus or having an abortion now another conflict between parents and the fetusconcerns the failure of the doctor to detect malformation in the fetus all would be parents want perfect babies and when their baby is born with a defect they feel the urge to sue someone usually the doctor if the doctor could have discovered the defect before birth the parents would have selected abortionratherthan having a defective baby to care for this leads to wrongful birth lawsuits even sometimes by the persons born with burdensome defects modern doctors now have a duty to detect fetal abnormalities at least they have the duty to offer to do teststhat could detect such abnormalities if the parents refuse these tests then they give up their right to sue if the fetus is defective a specific example we now know a great deal about the brain development of fetuses if the neural tube does not fuse by an early date in gestation the fetus will never be a person who can think and feel it will be a vegetable given such a prognosis most prospective parents would terminate the pregnancy the other option is caring for an organismthat will never be able to think or respond perhaps like keeping a large fish in an aquarium at home to help them consider their options the prospective parentsshould be shown videotapes of such children then they can ask themselves whether they want to devotea significant part of their lives to caring for such a creature the preceding summary and responsesemerged by the first chapter of the beginning of human life which was written by the editors the concept of person has also been subject to legal definition for example a slave was not a person in the early united states only after slavery was abolished in did former slaves become legal persons likewise women were not recognized as persons who could vote until on the other hand the law has long defined corporationsas persons for many purposes just when a fetus becomes a person is a question much debatedin academic legal religious contexts does a person born alive have a right to suefor something that happened to it several months or years earlier while it was still in its mother s womb what is the personhood status of a fetusthat is temporarily removed from its mother s womb but still attached by its umbilical cord in order to permit surgery and then is returned to the womb at what size or weight will personhood be declaredfor fetuses that are raised in test tubes gestation is not yet possible in artificial wombs but someday this is likely to be possible when would such fetuses gain various rights opponents of all forms of abortionwant to define a fetus as a person from the moment of conception some would like to amend various constitutions to enshrine this view and one court even decided to define a fetus as a person even tho this went against hundreds of years of court usage if brain death is defined at the end of brain stem activity perhaps brain life could be defined as the beginning of human life this would mean that once the neural tube has closed to form the tissuesthat will later develop into the brain stem of the fetus this organism should be declared a person others suggest that the emergence of detectable brain wavesshould be defined as the beginning of a human person but since brain waves exist even during sleep we know that brain waves alonedo not indicate the presence of consciousness if we believe that a person must have a brain then clearly personhood does not begin at conception since a single cell does not have a brain which defective infants should we attempt to save a common standard used in the united states but not in other advanced countries is a survival rate if out of fetuses in this condition will survive with treatment it should be done even tho the other fetuses will dieno matter how well the treatment is applied reviewer s comment if the costs of the treatment is per infant the total cost of treating all infants is million if this cost were assigned only to the surviving infants it would come to million each does anyone believe this is too much to pay for a baby and even many of the surviving babies will have life long problems which will have to be borne by the parentsand the individuals themselves and what about the effect on the parents whose infants die sets of such parents will suffer thru many weeks of treatments only to be completely disappointed in the end because those fetuses will die no matter what is done for them if these families had to bear the medical costs themselves most would pull the plug much sooner there would be little point in putting all the family s moneyinto one defective newborn who will probably have a poor quality of life even if it does survive parents and doctors should decide about defective newborns not lawyers and judges the parents will consult people they know and trust such as family friends clergy people doctors will have a closer look at this particular baby perhaps consulting the medical literature to see what has happenedin similar cases to other babies with similar problems but lawyers and judges with spend their time looking at legal definitionsand the particular wording of laws rather than looking at the baby the law necessarily deals with abstractions but a defective newborn is not an abstraction when lawmakers are asked to write new lawsabout the care of defective infants they will always choose to affirm life no matter how painful and limited that life might be they too are governed by abstractions rather than by compassionfor the actual individuals involved in this very difficult decision this review has discussed only some of the issues raised in this book if the beginning of human life is a live issue for you this is one book that will set your mind thinkingin many different directions if you are interested in similar attempst to define personhood search the

particular wording of laws rather than looking at the baby the law necessarily deals with abstractions but a defective newborn is not an abstraction when lawmakers are asked to write new laws about the care of defective infants they will always choose to affirm life no matter how painful and limited that life might be they too are governed by abstractions rather than by compassion for the actual individuals involved in this very difficult decision this review has discussed only some of the issues raised in this book if the beginning of human life is a live issue for you this is one book that

       "  'Raw Input': 'worth its weight ten times over in pieces of eight on one side stood the devil captain who backed by the merchant and royal official held near dictorial powers that served captialism globally on the other side stood the relentlessly dangerous narural world the deep blue sea in this fine and scholarly work by buford rediker the reader will find a bottom up history of the common seaman focusing on roughly the early th century some what like howard zinn s peoples history some years later on the american worker the sailor tar experiences of that time pointed in many ways toward the industrial revolution to come in the domain of culture as in others seamen were enmeshed in the momentous transition in which the world came to be governed by capitalism and class it is organized topically beginning with a survey of the seaman s world circa which tours the major ports of the british north atlantic describes the commodities piled on the docks and quays and details those aspects of political economy and history that shaped the seaman s life chapter discusses the organiztion and experience of work at sea chapter considers the wage in free wage labor and analyzes wage rates and negotiations chapter examines culture and community at sea chapter explores maritime authority and labor discipline chapter investigates the social world of piracy and how it effected the larger culture of maritime labor the conclusion analyzes the seaman s experience to the process of social change and working class development in america and england the jolly tar did indeed live in a world possessed of a sordid vicious side his creative survival is the suject of this book at times in gruesome details there are quotes in the oringinal written word and there are many detailed footnotes maps and several oringinal illustrations that were of the times it is very well written researhced in depth analyses of those times reading this is time well spent not only enriched by the history itself but more importantly how it coincides with the new world order s globalization of today s world in the words of one seaman those who would go to sea for pleasure would go to hell for pastime as the old sea song said a damned hard life full of toil and strife they took to the sea because they could not get bread by land work at sea meant virtual incarceration asa seaman was forcibly assimulated into a severe shipboard regimen of despotic authority discipline and control shipboard life constituted a binding chain of linked limits limited freedom limited movemen limited sensory stimulation and limited choices of liesure activities socil interaction food and play there was too little space aboard the ship and too much outside as an old salt explained to a green hand there is no justice or injustice on board ship my lad there are only two things duty and mutiny mind that all that you are ordered to do is duty all that you refuse to do is mutiny the green hand would soon find out what an almost universal feature of life was for an th century sailor the unrestricted power of the captain to treat his men with the utmost cruelty without redress since the capitalist mode of production ultimately requires the sale and purchase of labor poer in a marketthrough the medium of the wage a major imperative of early mpdern capitalist developmentwas the simultaneuos dispossession of large numbers of small property holders and the consolidation and centralization of newly available property in the hands of a minority the major sources of dispossession were disbanding of fuedal retainers the dissolution of feudal monasteries changes in agricultural methods foreclosure by debt and probably best known of all enclosure wealthy land owners enclosed their lands and extinguished the common rights they hang the man and flog the woman who steals the goose from off the common but let the greater criminal loose who steals the common from the goose old verse of the times the many were then suddenly and forcebly torn from their prior means of subsistence and hurled on the labor market as free unprotected and rightless proletarians they had no alternative but to sell their labor power to make a living the next stop between the devil the deep blue sea what i enjoyed most was that this period was protrayed by the author for what it was a long slow uneven and bloody transition from fuedalism to capitalism one illustration i liked by hogarth anticipated the claim that the gallows and whip lined the road to wage labor in this domain of culture as in others the seamen were emeshed in the momentous transition in which the world came to be governed by capitalism class the rise of deep sea supremacy began with the founding of the russian company the eastland company the levant company the east india company and considerably later the royal adventures into africa soon to become royal african company the history is something i never learned in high school for instance during queen anne s reign seaman had enterred the navy like men dragged to execution and that is precisely what naval service amounted to for untold thousands since almost half of all those pressed into the th th centuries died at sea or how a seaman wrote about the east india company but for nations to come and plant themselves in islands and countries by force and build forts and raise laws and force the people to customs against the true natures and people of the said places without their consent how this wiil stand with the law of god and the religion we profess lrt the world be the judge this book was published in iraq afghanistan were on the drawing board in the s or that a leading expert on illicit trade argues that in the early modern period smugglers accounted for at least one half the english overseas trade between and was the golden century of smuggling maritime workers in this early period by linking the producers and consumers of the world through their labors in the international markets were central to the accumulation of riches on ascale previously unimagined at the same time they were crucial to the emergence of new relations between capital and labor employments connected to shipping were notorious then as later a precarious occupations nice work if you can get it life and labor in precarious times by andrew ross about st century labor markets it should come as no surprise then that the collectivism that informed the seafaring work that the very term strike evolved from the decision of british seamen in to strike the sails of their vessels and thereby to cripple the commerce of the empire s capital city the collectivism of the ship was vertical that of the common wage earning seaman horizontal the international capitalist economy wasemerging as an increasingly cooperative totality and the strategically situated merchant seaman provided many of the links in the system the completely contractual and waged nature of maritime work represented a capital labor relation quite distinct from the landlord tenant master servant or master apprentice relationships the pay systems of the seamen were very well detailed and analysed from how they were intiated and how they evolved ship owners merchants and ship captains aspired to enhance the accumulation of capital by controlling wages food and drink or customary usage social access to the product spatial perogatives and the nature of the voyage inded the very process of accumulation was built upon thr bilked wages the pinched guts and often the very lives prematurely ended of men at sea a central part of capital s plan during the early and uncertain stages of expansion was to shift as many of the burdens and risks associated with the growing but ubstable atlantic economy as possible to the seaman s shoulders there were two networks of information one purveyed information about ship masters and their customary usage of sailors the other carried reports of the discipline skills and behavoir of the maritime workers the former was constructed by and for seamen the latter by and for ship owners merchants and captains the very sucess of pirates between and depended upon their access to the information that flowed through this informal network the pirate chapterwas my favorite probably sumed up best by pirate charles bellamy you are a sneaking puppy and so are those who submit to be governed by laws which rich men have made for their own security for the cowardly whelps have not the courage to defend what they get by their knavery but damn ye altogether they villify us the scoundrels do when there is only this difference they rob the poor under cover of law forsooth and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage or as pirate barnaby slush said without justice there can be no true discipline no love no followers so in essence the pirate ship was a school in social and economic democracy collectivism antiauthoritarianism and egalitarianism were the core values ate their hearts that of the common seaman s ethos the court system of those times upheld the perogatives of capital despite the legality of the matter enabling merchants and masters to respond as profitably as possible to international opportunities most commanders of those times cared not how much or in what way they can get it all to themselves and care not what little other people get under them they were all out to gain what they can either by hook or crook the social isolation of the captain like so much of maritime culture as a whole thus resulted from two very different social dynamics the search from above for corporate authority and the search from below for autonomy if i could do it over i would have read this before i read the the patrick o brien aubrey maturin series there is so much laid out in these pages that puts one not only in the sialor s soes but the ships as well extremely detailed and informative to the tasks at hand dr samuel johnson is one of my perennial favorites and he observed no man wii be a sailor who has contrivance enough to get himself into a jail for being on a ship is being in a jail with the chance of being drowned a man in jail has more room better food and more commonly better company epidemics and scurvy raged on royal ships and the men were caught in a machine from which there was no escape but desertion incapacitation or death or piracy the parallels about the first worldwide commercial globalization process closely rhymes with the current new world order globalization process highly recommended p s the history of power teaches us one thing if it is unchecked it will be abused bruce fein'},\n",

       "  'Raw Input': 'a good sequel almost as good as the first rebel angels is the second novel in libba bray s gemma doyle trilogy gemma and her friends are now in london for the winter holidays they are still attempting to figure out who circe is and stop her before she destroys the realms but they also trying to lead meaningful and fun social lives the experience london s high society and find themselves once again lost in the realms bray s second installment has all the fantasy and creativity of her first novel the girls have to learn how to behave in society especially when ann is lying to everyone about her past and gemma has to learn how to deal with her new romance with a viscount s son as well as her current relationship with kartik the theme of growing up never leaves the narrative and it is just as funny and clever as ever hello girl in the mirror you are gemma doyle and i ve no idea who you really are gemma is still trying to figure out who she really is she has many different faces that she puts on for her family and her friends she cannot figure out her purpose in life and throughout the entire novel she is being deceived by a woman that she saw as a friend and almost motherly figure she is trying to piece together clues to figure out who circe is but every clue she finds she manipulates to serve her own purposes she believes circe is her new teacher because she wants to believe it is her even when gemma is told that her teacher is not circe she doesn t believe her everything gemma does is to try to help but she has no one to guide her without tricking her another main theme in this novel is parents as protectors gemma s father is riddled with addiction after addiction and no matter how hard gemma or her brother try neither she nor he can help their father become clean gemma tries to heal him with magic but she finally realizes that she cannot heal him she can only help him find the way himself it is revealed that felicity s father sexually abused her when she was younger but felicity believed it was her fault felicity says that parents should protect their children but it is clear that is not always possible gemma and felicity both realize that they are strong and that they cannot bear their parents burdens bray also deals with the topic of racism after kartik and gemma kiss kartik tells her that she doesn t want to be with him because he is indian and the reader discovers that gemma never thought she had be demure or chaste with kartik because she knew nothing could ever happen i found this to be a shocking revelation because bray never tells you that interracial marriages didn t occur the book seems so modern that i completely forget that was unprecedented at the end of novel gemma asks kartik to join the order as an ally along with several other groups of people that had never been granted power by the order gemma is stretching across a divide and uniting people that had never been united before yet again bray deals with the ideas of grief and loss but in an entirely new way upon returning to the realms the girls discover that here their friend pippa is alive and well even though gemma has been told that no one can stay there and not cross over without becoming corrupted the reader can instantly see that pippa has not escaped corruption but the girls do not see it because they are happy to have their friend back after circe is defeated pippa is forced to make a choice cross over or enter the winterlands rather than cross over into the unknown pippa decides to join the corrupt in the winterlands this choice is not surprising because this is coming from the girl who chose a perfect dream world rather than be forced into an arranged marriage once again pippa has refused to accept reality she should realize that she has died but she doesn t and she chooses to become corrupt in the hopes that she can stay in the realms forever pippa also blames gemma for her death when she was the one who chose it creating parallels to modern day suicide gemma couldn t have done anything to save pippa because it was her choice but gemma still feels guilty about her death the character of miss moore once again has super amazing quotes about life and death and good and evil she says that maybe there is no good or evil only choices once she is revealed to be circe the reader is forced to think more clearly about the line between right and wrong circe is doing what she thinks is right for her but her motivations are selfish and harmful gemma choices constantly show that she is thinking not only about the safety of the realms but also of her friends and family kartik and gemma also discuss whether destiny exists or if life is controlled by choices leaving the answer up to the reader kartik makes it seem like it is the choices that you make that lead you to fulfilling your destiny giving a great purpose to every choice made the novel focuses heavily on deception and lies over the course of both books miss moore has been lying to the girls making them see her as an ally but in rebel angels there is also the deception of ann which is not so different from the lies of miss moore ann tells everyone in london society that she is rich and powerful when in fact she is poor and helpless both ann and miss moore are lying to try to get what they desperately desire they want to get out of the lives that have been chosen for them eventually they are both forced to come clean and ann loses the affection of gemma s brother and miss moore losses the affection of gemma in books the truth makes everything good and fine but it s not like that really is it no i suppose it only makes everything known but underneath all these wonderful themes or i guess i should say above the themes is a rich story about love and acceptance am i the only one who hated simon from the start i just kept shouting at the book rapist because he seemed like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader wonder how far he has gone before without someone saying no gemma s relationship with simon is fake polite and strained she finds him charming but there is always the secret of what she can do lurking under the surface and she knows that he wouldn t love her if he knew about it this relationship is directly contrasted with gemma s relationship with kartik she is free to be who she really is she doesn t have to pretend to be coy or lady like and they really only talk business though there are moments of genuine friendship and understanding the reason this relationship is so appealing to the reader and trust me i squeal every time they do something adorable is that it s so very romantic kartik and gemma are in their own little world and whenever they meet it has this danger behind it they are relying on one another for help and guidance and they ve grown trust and a bond that is separated from the real world the thing i find hilarious about kartik though is that he never does anything he literally never does anything they talk about what gemma needs to do but because he can t enter the realms he can t help her in any way he can only help her understand the clues she s found and then kiss her because the book needs some sexy romance but finally finally kartik gives up everything he has ever known to help gemma escape the rakshana and i think that he will finally do something instead they split up gemma sleeps for three days wakes up and never even thinks to check on him or ask him for help and then leaves for the realms to defeat circe she comes back and after like two days she goes to see him and asks him to be an ally it s been what a week i find this unforgivable kartik gave up his entire life to help her and then she leaves him sitting in his bedroom for a week he doesn t get to help her fight and he doesn t get to even see her it seems like kartik is only there for the kissing and i want to see him actually getting out and doing something i know this book is all about girl power and strength but really he needs to do something with his life but i really did like this book i m not sure that i liked it as much as the first one i wasn t really surprised by anything rebel angels threw at me but it was well written and the themes were great as always d like such a rapist he forces gemma and her friends to drink absinthe and then he tries to take advantage of her thankfully she says no and he doesn t but it makes the reader wonder how far he has gone before without someone saying no gemma s relationship with simon is fake polite and strained she finds him charming but there is always the secret of what she can do lurking
