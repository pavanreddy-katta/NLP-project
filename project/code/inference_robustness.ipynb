      "Raw Input Sentence: levelling the playing field the level playing field is an expression favored by economists come to think of it this is weird it is difficult to imagine a playing field that is tilted against one team if this is the case it shouldn t have been called a playing field in the first place likewise it makes little sense to level a playing field that is tilted from the start instead of calling the bulldozer it is better to stop the game and move the players to another playing ground where each team has a fair chance to win of course some teams are simply better than others regardless of the field they play on for the interest of the game it may be worthwhile to introduce some kind of handicap to tilt the field in some way in order to redress the balance and to give each team an opportunity to win what is needed in this case is not a level playing field but a set of rules that takes account of each team s strengths and weaknesses and that adapts the game accordingly this linguistic remark aside almost everyone agrees that economic transactions should be carried out on a level playing field and that the rules of the game should be fair but as ethan kapstein notes people have a different opinion of what constitutes the sources of fairness or unfairness in the global economy in his introductory chapter the author presents three models of international economic justice each advanced by different scholars and supported by different constituencies some people criticize increasing economic integration because of its allegedly deleterious effects on domestic social and economic arrangements this is what ethan kapstein calls the communitarian critique which takes domestic society as the appropriate site of distributive justice because it is only with this political context that coercive fiscal and redistributive policies can take place according to this view economic justice can only be achieved one nation at a time some scholars call this position embedded liberalism and see it as a cornerstone of the postwar economic order which guaranteed full employment and social protection at the national level while exempting many trade and financial transactions from complete liberalization the second model of economic justice identified by the author is the cosmopolitan challenge which is concerned with the welfare of individuals irrespective of national boundaries it demands justice for all and a fair share of the pie for each individual this is the perspective taken by the world bank and other international organizations in their fight against poverty cosmopolitans see a world where global public policies would redistribute revenue and wealth away from the well off and would benefit the haves not who would gain higher utility from an extra dollar whatever the practical merit of these redistributive policies they indicate the cosmopolitan sensibility of treating people as members of one universal community each of whom has a claim to the world s resources the third intellectual tradition to which the author belongs does not focus solely on the individual nor does it place the sole locus of economic justice on the national community instead it takes seriously the relations among states based on equality sovereignty and the national interest but it doesn t lose sight of the plight of the world s poor either this liberal internationalist perspective also referred to as social liberalism seeks to build a just international system that would meet the three criteria of being inclusive participatory and welfare enhancing it is close to john rawls vision of a just world order and it borrows from the american philosopher notions such as the veil of ignorance as well as a certain skepticism towards foreign aid these distinctions may sound like typical academic hairsplitting and indeed the reader who comes to this book unprepared by readings in politicalphilosophy is in for heady stuff but applying the author s framework leads to some interesting conclusions for instance you might think considering kaplan s attachment to world justice that he would stand on the side of anti globalizers and wto critics quite the opposite kaplan stands squarely on the side of free trade and foreign direct investment greater openness to trade and investment is identified as a sure policy winner the best shot we have at achieving global economic justice it should feature high on the agenda of any person of group seeking a more just international system writes kaplan free trade may be viewed as a uniquely suited instrument for promoting international economic justice for the very reason that it bolsters the growth of the least advantaged regions in a manner that is welfare enhancing for all states kapstein argues quoting kenneth boulding that the case for free trade has always been a moral one provided of course and it is an important caveat that the trade regime allows developing countries to have a voice in setting rules and standards in other words it should not only be welfare enhancing but also inclusive and participatory but the playing field is often tilted against least developed countries who face trade barriers in the sectors in which they possess comparative advantage like agriculture and textile some people argue that rules negotiated under the trips agreement may prevent patients in poor countries to get access to aids therapies reforming the trade regime would require giving developing world governments substantially more voice than they have at present in the negotiating process kapstein applies the same principled analysis to the issues of foreign aid workers remittances migration flows labor standards and codes of conduct for multinational enterprises in each case his purpose is to map the contours of some politically feasible changes with respect to contemporary economic arrangements on each problem he shows that the cosmopolitan perspective often adopted by international organizations and ngos leads to impractical solutions and dead ends cosmopolitans usually claim the moral high ground for themselves but fail to deliver on their political promises their dream is a world free of poverty but they stop short of providing a playing field where each country could compete equally for instance notes kapstein it does little good to provide countries with aid if they cannot increase their exports that is the definition of absurdity by contrast his liberal internationalist perspective brings sensible conclusions and a practical agenda for reform although economic justice in an unfair world is an interesting book it is not a great book obviously judging from weak sales and limited references in the subsequent literature it failed to make a dent in the landscape of globalization studies the author did not achieve a theoretical tour de force like the philosophers from which he draws inspiration nor did he succeed in changing the terms of public debate ethan kapstein is no thomas friedman of the world is flat fame his book stays in between philosophical speculation and economic description too complex for busy readers too practical for academics likewise his policy prescriptions will look insufficiently ambitious for cosmopolitans who would advocate for a more ambitious reshuffling of the political order but it will also frustrate neo realists who focus on the national interest without much consideration for global public goods ethan kapstein might get a second chance to make his point watch out for his next book and skip this one in the meantime author s framework leads to some interesting conclusions for instance you might think considering kaplan s attachment to world justice that he would

      "Raw Input Sentence: enjoyable read hard review it is hard to review this twofer although they take place in the same universe the two books are vaguely connected the clock of dreams ends lumley s first titus crow trilogy while spawn of the the winds begins his second trilogy it would have been better for tor to publish the three twofers as two three in ones thereby keeping the trilogies separate if they needed to have three books then the should have published asin the compleat crow the short story collection as a third volume i see the vortex blaster problem in play here the six official lensman books are frequently republished but uniformly the vortex blaster is dropped from the series admittedly it does not follow the main story line but neither does the horse and his boy follow the main narnia storyline and in adam s hitchiker s guide omnibus they include the fragment young zaphod beeblebrox it seems to be incomplete but it is still included because it is relevant to the overall series the point being that in all cases we should include all the relevant books in the series end of rant now to the books the clock of dreamsfive stars for the title alone this magic coupling of the words clock and dreams was the reason why i began reading the series this story tightens the connection between hpl s universe and lumley s elaboration we meet the dreamer carter asin dreams of terror and death the dream cycle of h p lovecraft and also etienne laurent de marigny from out of the aeons asin the loved dead collected short stories vol ii wordsworth mystery supernatural i would have liked an appendix showing where lumley got his characters but i guess i will have to bone up on my lovecraft on my own this story abandoned the archival format and had a detached storyteller format so we resume a third person narrative the first person is always engaging and makes the story seem real the distance diminished the emotional impact of the horror and this is no longer a horror series but fantasy adventure this is fine series need to evolve to keep things fresh also since this is the third in a trilogy we also have the phenomenon of winding down the loose ends are tied up the marrying and the burying as twain put it i m not sure if the ending is a deus ex machina it is close but since lumley knows how to end a book with force and power i forgive him lumley compensates for three of lovecraft s weaknesses courage there are no victims of horror but people who fight back romance these courageous people fall in love balance the evil is balanced by a present good that is bold and impressive it is this last one good that is bold and impressive that fascinates me bold and impressive is how i would describe kthanid cthulhu s goody two shoes brother as a god figure he rivals c s lewis aslan asin the chronicles of narnia movie tie in edition adult if we can forgive christ for being depicted as a lion we can certainly forgive g d for being depicted as an octo head in these myths but it s not his appearance rather his presence that conveys a sense of cosmic majesty as his last battle shows kthanid is not a tame octopus spawn of the windsthis book is mistitled it should be called child of the winds or princess of the winds lumley i think realizes he has slipped into urban fantasy adventure the title hearkens back to his lovecraftian roots but it does not fit the story the second problem is that this begins a second trilogy the series is rebooted with new characters and situations the ccd are there asin the ithaqua cycle the wind walker of the icy wastes call of cthulhu fiction the star stones are prominent and we still have the wilmarth foundation but we meet some of their other operations and their other heroes so this is both a plus and a minus the third problem is that since this is a reboot we never meet crow and de maurigny i kept expecting them to appear so this unmet expectation kept nagging my mind and interfering with the pleasure of writing the dynamic duo appear in the next volume so this problem also is a plus and a minusall else is good lumley returns the archival format with it verisimilitude of classified documents mj documents eat your heart out the change of setting is exactly what a series like this needs coming from finishing dune hunters of dune and sandworms of dune the ice world is exactly what i needed i felt like i was pulled into the snow dunes of the early jack london prospecting short stories asin jack london novels and stories call of the wild white fang the sea wolf klondike and other stories library of america you have the man versus man conflict and the man verses mad demon conflict but in the background there is the man versus icelandic waste conflict it does not affect the story but it does brood in the sidelines we have shifted from horror to fantasy adventure the story has the excitement of asin the lost world but the magic of indiana jones crow is enigmatic and de maurigny has his moments but hank silberhutte is straight from the classic pulps i say classic pulp because the story has all the force of a pulp but clearly follows the pattern square jawed texan entering the realm of a fairy princess a stranger he masters the realm vanquishes the evil and gets the girl in the end classic joseph campbell and this story should be familiar to you you read it

      "Raw Input Sentence: my first sigma force at the outset of this review i need to make a couple of things clear i was asked by the pr dept at harper collins if i would accept a free copy of this book and review it i imagine they asked me along with other mormon writers bloggers to do this due to the book s subject matter including mormons and mormon history i accepted without any strings attached there exists no agreement that i would necessarily review this book favorably the review below is my honest appraisal of this book with zero input from harper collins i believe that i am the target audience for this book i am an adult male who loves espionage thrillers and history i m assuming that since i am obviously mormon and harper collins asked me to do this review that they wanted me to add a mormon perspective what i say in this review is not an official position of my church but it is my very nit picky take on how mr rollins treats his subject matter i shall start with my nit picking so that i can get it out of the way and review the book on its overall merit nits and picks maggie grantham is a byu professor not explicitly described as lds hank kanosh is a mormon and byu professor as well he chews stogies which is referred to in the book as a necessary concession but there is a reference to a tryst between these two with no judgement of such a thing lds doctrine considers an extra marital sexual tryst as far more serious than chewing on a stogie this would be of extreme significance to these two people in the context of their lds culture it would inform much of these people s lives and what they do also both professors are expected to live by byu s honor code a sexual tryst is far far outside that code referring to the mormon church as the church of latter day saints is a sign of an incomplete knowledge of the church its doctrine and history it s officially called the church of jesus christ of latter day saints shortened to the lds church the mormon church or the mormons joseph smith is the name of the man who translated the golden plates which translation became the book of mormon rollins gets this right early in the book but inexplicably starts calling him john smith about halfway through the book and never gets it right again there is a point in the book wherein kanosh remember a mormon from birth ostensibly seems to be meeting the prophet president of the lds church to give him something of great value kanosh does this in the salt lake city temple apparently right outside the holy of holies not likely at all and kanosh kneels in front of the prophet that s very not mormon people meet the lds prophet all the time we shake his hand and absolutely do not worship the man and that my friends is it harmless little things there are plenty of other interesting references to mormon beliefs particularly regarding the history of the peoples talked about in the book of mormon but those are generally authorial fabrications made in order to tell the story now the review james rollins is very like a combination of dan brown matt reilly and clive cussler i would say that he is all three of those authors on their best day i liked the devil colony about times more than anything i have read by dan brown particularly since rollins demonstrates zero addiction to melodramatic adverbs and this book was populated by real people who do things that exact a real price upon them that s also why the devil colony is more effective than clive cussler s work which i quite enjoy dirk pitt cussler s usual hero seems completely invincible and to always have the answers there is never much doubt about the inevitable outcome of pitt s adventures matt reilly is another favorite thriller writer for me and rollins really compares wellto reilly the difference is that reilly s action is so non stop that you forget who s doing what sometimes and there are a couple of eye rolls that come about with reilly s work i have to say i think the devil colony is the best modern thriller i have read in ages this is because the characters really seem human kai is a particularly good character her inner dialogue is deftly done and she never seems like a throwaway character but each person is flawed and they each have relationships that motivate what they re doing they also all go through hell and pay a price for their narrow escapes and successes i like it when a character uses ingenuity to fix the fix that they re in another place that the devil colony shines is that it s a team effort the sigma force is a group of folks who are all insanely intelligent and they work together i like that they made solid use of modern technology to stay in touch and coordinate their efforts the real time sense of the pacing also lent a nice feeling of authenticity to the story the characters are interesting and well developed with plenty going on internally to lend tension to the conflicts around the characters rollins like many other thriller writers uses rd person omniscient thus enabling him to allow the reader to follow the antagonist this is effectively done in the devil colony and again it s far better than anything by dan brown browns villains all feel like they re out of an old melodrama like klondike kalamity rafael saint germaine the main antagonist of the devil colony is an intriguing fellow whose secrets are murky but who seems like a real fellow a bad fellow mostly but a real one this is a big book it comes in at pages but it was engaging enough and well paced to the point that i felt like it was a quick read even the prose is smooth and well crafted rollins is clearly a master of this game as a book a novel length story i really don t have anything critical to say about the devil colony it s very creative manages cliffhangers very well moves things along at a suitably breathless clip makes you mostly care about the characters and pulls some slick twists i liked the book as a dyed in the wool true blue mormon a convert yes but nonetheless i found nothing at which to take offense rollins takes a few liberties but they re more or less innocuous i d like to chat with the fellow about some of his research actually i d say read the book if you like thrillers you ll love the devil colony vast in scope daring in its implications and rollicking in its action it s a great read out of pens re are a

      "Raw Input Sentence: indie book review asatru for beginners a few days ago i got a new review query this one had a book in it called asatru for beginners asatru is a recreated version of the ancient norse religions now i was a religious studies major in college i ve got friends in the pagan and wiccan communities i m pretty well versed in the various new age magickal philosophies i read fantasy i write fantasy i m up to date on my european mythos no one needed to point out to me who wednesday was in american gods so this looked like a fine addition to the vast pile of religious information in my arsenal i was happy to accept it for review now i m not by any stretch of anyone s imagination an expert on norse mythology i can identify odin freya midgard thor etc and because of my rs background concepts like a multipartite soul was already something i d run into but given all of that i found asatru for beginners to be confusing first off the formatting was doing nothing to make the reading easier the kindle sample i downloaded had real issues on the most basic level if you start the book off with a faq doing something to differentiate the questions from the answers indenting starting them off with q or a putting the questions in bold or italic anything would have made the reading easier maybe post faq the formatting improved but the author sent me a doc version so i don t know if the kindle version improved secondly beginning with a faq was a bit odd not just because of the questions asked did the vikings wear helmets with horns on their heads are all asatuars white and not asked who are the main gods what is ragnarok but because if you really are a beginner a quick overview before getting into the faq would have been helpful beyond a faq what this book very much needed was a glossary for every question the faq answered there were at least three terms with no definition or a definition that occurred much later in the book likewise a pronunciation guide would have come in handy terms like fjorgynn ljossalfheim fylgia have no sound in my mind i have no idea how to pronounce them thirdly it is very clear this was written by someone who knows absolute scads of information on the subject and has known scads of information for so long that she s forgotten what sorts of things a beginner doesn t know for example there s a section with a list of gods in this section we learn of the god s hall and where the god has influence now while i m sure this information is useful to someone who already knows something about the subject if you don t really know what a hall is or where these places are supposed to be it s confusing likewise the term ragnarok is used something like twenty times before it s defined in effect this book would more correctly be called asatru for already conversant with norse mythology or asatru for the low intermediate fourthly the organization of this book left a lot to be desired it s laid out in sections frequently asked questions history the gods other beings beliefs and morality rituals the three kinds of magic and resources now as a logical flow goes this didn t flow all that well there were often bits where i d want more information and that information would be in a later section as i understand a religion it s the beliefs that are the core i would have started there moved into rituals as we learn in the beliefs section asatru is a religion of actions not belief then gods and other beings slid from there into history finished up with magic and then wrapped up the book with the faq glossary and list of resources so now that we ve gotten the book as a device for the transmittal of information out of the way how about the quality of that information now as i said earlier i m not an expert on this subject but from the very brief bit of independent research i did everythingin the book looked fine other asatruas might have different opinions on the subject but to an outsider it appeared to be complete the writing was engaging and fairly easy to follow it was a quick and pleasant two hour read with a good deal of information i had never run into before as a religion asatru had things i appreciated and bits i was less than thrilled with i m a fan of religions based on actions rather than beliefs and asatru is a religion of action you do not have to believe in literal land spirits to be an asatruar but you do have keep the folkways likewise the idea that works of both men and women is of value held appeal and the very intense affection for freedom struck a resonant chord however as a moral framework asatru did nothing for me but as the author pointed out it s the morality of a pirate culture these were not pacifistic farmers living in harmony tilling the soil this is a recreated version of the faith of the vikings and the vikings were not known as easy neighbors there appears to be no idea that a human is of value because he is a human anything that improves the lot of the family clan tribe country the unit gets bigger as populations grow is good anything that harms that is evil rape murder theft those are all fine and dandy as long as not done to members of your group meanwhile oath breaking is considered just as bad as killing a member of your group and while i m a massive fan of keeping your pledges i m also a fan of the idea that humans are of value and harming outsiders for personal gain is not appropriate in effect asatru is a religion where the actions of the nazis can be seen as honorable they were after all out conquering their neighbors to improve the lot of their own narrowly defined group the jews gays politicals mental and physical defectives were all defined as others they weren t part of the master race killing them and confiscating their goods to enrich the race is by asatru thinking a moral good the great irony here being that the asatruars were also rounded up classified as politicals and killed by the nazis now the author points out that she personally considers fascism evil but she also points out that s her own personal interpretation of their morality and that others disagree obviously i may be missing some of the subtleties of the religion and i m going off of just the one book here but i m not seeing anything besides a sense of personal disgust that would condemn the nazis or any other group before or since that decided to destroy the other to enrich itself at the same time there is an elegant and unapologetic simplicity to the morality of asatru the rules are exceptionally easy to follow there is no existential angst no worries as to the nature of salvation or forgiveness sin is a matter of breaking the law and the laws are few and far between live well enrich you and yours keep your word die fighting your enemies and you too shall dwell in the halls of your gods feasting and practicing combat until the end times come and you once again pick up your sword and fight for your kind all in all if you really are a beginner i d suggest heading over to wikipedia and searching asatru not only will you get about the same amount of information about k words but the wiki article is easier to understand and better organized then once you ve read that go get asatru for beginners to start filling in the holes and rounding out the picture t have different opinions on the subject but to an outsider it appeared to be complete the writing was engaging and fairly easy to follow it was a quick and pleasant two hour read with a good deal of

      "Raw Input Sentence: do you like any fans out there of shows that keep you on the end of your seat anticpating the next scene the next bit of action that is how this book the tehran initiative plays out it is written in such a way that weaves you right into this vividly detailed narative joel rosenberg does a tremendous job at creating a story line that is so real true to life it almost seems to blend with current news what s real what s not you must check this title out at your local christian bookstore i have also attached an interview that he did so you can hear in his own words what drives his style of writting enjoy an interview with joel c rosenberg author of the tehran initiative this is the second book with cia operative david shirazi where does the story pick up from your previous bestseller the twelfth imam a the tehran initiative begins about sixty seconds after the twelfth imam leaves off i ve tried to create a near seamless connection between the two and there s another book coming the damascus countdown you started writing the tehran initiative when the arab spring began earlier this year did events impact your writing or the storyline a actually i was well into writing the tehran initiative when the arab spring began and it was a little eerie because the novel opens with the assassination of the president egypt and egypt descending into chaos after the leader s fall fortunately egyptian president hosni mubarak wasn t killed but he certainly fell quickly and somewhat unexpectedly and egypt is still reeling from the aftermath the novel really focuses a great deal on the intense desire amongst many muslims in the middle east and north africa to build a global islamic empire or a caliphate and that s certainly a growing theme among the islamists in the region this year perhaps what struck me most curious since the publication of the twelfth imam and while i was researching and writing the tehran initiative is that the so called supreme leader of iran the ayatollah ali khamenei has began speaking more publicly about the coming of the twelfth imam he used to be silent or nearly so on this subject he let president ahmadinejad do all the public talking about shia end times theology but khamenei has become more bold over the past year or so he has told people that he has met personally with the twelfth imam though we don t know what he meant did he meet with a flesh and blood person did he see a dream or a vision we don t know but khamenei has also asserted that he is the personal representative on earth of the twelfth imam as well as the so called prophet muhammad these developments along with his support for iran s aggressive nuclear development program suggest khamenei senses the time is very short before some claiming to be the twelfth imam emerges publicly in part that s why the iranian government released the pseudo documentary film in early called the coming is near about all the geopolitical signs that they believe are indicators that the mahdi s arrival is increasingly close at hand whether it will really happen or not remains to be seen but the iranian leadership is certainly convinced most of them anyway and of course the bible tells us in matthew chapter twenty four to expect false prophets and false messiahs in the last days so we can t rule out the possibility that we ll actually as false messiah emerge from the shia world you ve earned a reputation of writing stories that seemed ripped from tomorrow s headlines what is going on in the tehran initiative that we can see unfolding in the news a i think the biggest parallel between the tehran initiative and current events is the growing sense amongst shia muslim leaders particularly in iran that the twelfth imam is coming any moment coupled with iran s feverish efforts to build nuclear weapons and the israelis growing isolation in the world and feeling that they may have to hit iran all by themselves did you see iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad s apocalyptic address at the u n in september or read the full text you should it s instructive ahmadinejad is not a world leader worthy of the world stage he is the evil leader of an iranian death cult a recent u n report indicates he is making progress in building nuclear weapons he is calling for the arrival of the twelfth imam and wiping israel off the map he aspires to be a mass murderer beyond the scale of adolf hitler he deserves to be in prison or an insane asylum his u n speech was further proof if more was needed like hitler s speeches in germany in the s and s ahmadinejad isn t hiding what he believes he s pretty clear he denied the holocaust he blasted the u s for bringing osama bin laden to justice he blamed the terrorist attacks on the u s government he insisted that his so called messiah known as imam al mahdi or the twelfth imam is coming soon he insisted jesus christ will come with the mahdi to take over the world he called for a one world government when he called for the shared and collective management of the world consider these excerpts this movement is certainly on its rightful path of creation ensuring a promising future for humanity a future that will be built when humanity initiates to trend the path of the divine prophets and the righteous under the leadership of imam al mahdi the ultimate savior of mankind and the inheritor to all divine messengers and leaders and to the pure generation of our great prophet the creation of a supreme and ideal society with the arrival of a perfect human being who is a true and sincere lover of all human beings is the guaranteed promise of allah he will come alongside with jesus christ to lead the freedom and justice lovers to eradicate tyranny and discrimination and promote knowledge peace justice freedom and love across the world he will present to every single individual all the beauties of the world and all good things which bring happiness for humankind though most world leaders do not appear to understand what ahmadinejad is really saying students of shia islamic eschatology or end times theology do the iranian leader believes the end of the world as we have known it is increasingly close at hand he believes the time for establishing an islamic caliphate or global government ruled by the mahdi is rapidly approaching what s more he believes that the way to hasten the coming of the twelfth imam is to acquire nuclear weapons and use them to annihilate the united states which he calls the great satan and israel which he calls the little satan israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu understands what ahmadinejad means so do some of his top military advisors that s why they believe iran is in the eye of a gathering storm in the middle east and that the chance of a major war is growing iran has not abandoned its nuclear program the opposite is true it continues full steam ahead warned israeli defense forces home front command chief major general eyal eisenberg in a speech earlier this month also noting recent uprisings in the arab world and growing tensions with turkey eisenberg said this leads us to the conclusion that the likelihood of an all out war is increasingly growing to me all this feels ripped from the pages of the tehran initiative unfortunately it s all true readers seem to get very attached to your characters what goes into creating the characters in your novels a it s the colonel s secret recipe of seven herbs and spices i could tell you but then i d have to well never mind no comment to that one what experiences in your real life do you draw from to piece together these novels that incorporate geo politics espionage romance and bible prophecy a someone once told me write where you live in your head for some reason that advice resonated with me and stuck i m fascinated with politics prophecy and the middle east living in washington d c and working in and around the political world for the past two decades has certainly helped provide context for me to write political thrillers i think traveling extensively throughout the middle east and north africa has been helpful too somehow it s all worked together in a way some people find as interesting as i do you often incorporate old testament prophecy in your books what scriptures do you draw from for this book and why a there s no question that i am absolutely intrigued by bible prophecy and i like to start with an end times prophecy or a group of last days prophecies and ask what if these were to happen in my lifetime what would it look like what would it feel like how might such prophecies realistically be set into motion and what might be the implications of their fulfillment that s how i approach writing these books but i don t think of it like writing a fantasy novel or science fiction i m genuinely trying to imagine how it could really play out i m not saying these prophecies will necessarily come to pass the way i envision them but they are interest to war game and see what happens and given what s happening in the real world today i think readers are as curious as i am and somehow my plots don t feel that far fetched you ve been successful with your non fiction books epicenter and inside the revolution and you have a large following reading your analysis of middle east events on your blog and e newsletter flash traffic why do you continue to choose writing novels about the middle east a what could be more interesting presidents and presidential candidates constantly focus on the middle east prime ministers do kings do generals do the media does the economists do the fact is the eyes of the nations are riveted on israel and her neighbors the epicenter of the momentous events that are shaking our world and shaping our future the stakes are very high there is lots of uncertainty it s mysterious and dangerous and complex it has all the elements of riveting political thrillers and the bible says the middle east will become even more dramatic until the very return of jesus christ why write about anything else he beauties of the world and all good things which bring happiness for humankind though most world
